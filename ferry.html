<h1>A Ferry Expedition</h1>
<h2>Ride the Ferry</h2>
<figcaption>Imagine the thrill of boarding a ferry, the gentle sway of the boat as it sets off across the water. With the wind in your hair and the sun on your face, you can take in stunning views of the coastline and distant islands. This ride isn’t just about transportation; it’s an adventure that offers a unique perspective of the landscape, making you feel alive and connected to the world around you.</figcaption>
